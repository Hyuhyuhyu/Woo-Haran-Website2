	Woo Haran’s short film, <em>O, The Busy Idle Journey</em>, marks the first premiere work of the universe [O8kk].  In this film, Woo performs as Person Moon, taking on multiple creative roles. He produced, directed, and edited the film, and composed its improvisational score, featuring voice, hammered dulcimer, and chromatic harmonica, with a guest performer on alto saxophone.

<div class="bio_paragraph_work">
	<b>Synopsis:</b><br>
	The full moon fusses around in the night sky, eventually falling to Earth as a human.  This “Person Moon” wanders through surreal landscapes, seeming busy but not actually accomplishing anything.  In the end, near water, it spreads one of the “Sounds of the Universe” to the world.

	<em>윤슬 (Ever-Changing)</em> is a 5-minute audiovisual installation. It is based on an original musical composition of the same name for an 8-key marimba and two channels of processed field recordings. The installation features clips of streaming water, shimmering over ripples—reflecting the meaning of the title “윤슬”—within a computational environment. It intermittently displays the inventive graphic notation for the 8-key marimba, fragments of original poems about water circulation, and visual elements reminiscent of video editing software. The juxtaposition of the uninterrupted flow of water against the structured, computer-generated visuals creates a compelling contrast.

	<em>Na Ra Ga Da</em> is a visualizer of the original musical composition of the same name. The cyclical structure of the composition is derived from an alphabetical/musical analysis of the word “Na Ra Ga Da,” a non-standard romanization of the Korean word “날아가다,” meaning “fly.” The soundscape incorporates an audio recording of boiling water, symbolizing water molecules “flying” into the air. It is complemented by improvisational performances on finger cymbals, a plastic fork, and a woodwind instrument. The video visually interprets the music, depicting the gradual change of evaporating water.
